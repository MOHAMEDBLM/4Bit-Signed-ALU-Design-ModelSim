NMOS Arithmetic Unit for NI-Multisim

This project showcases the design and implementation of an NMOS-based 4-bit Arithmetic Unit capable of performing four essential operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The entire system is simulated using NI Multisim software.

==> Key Features:

Versatile Functionality: Our NMOS Arithmetic Unit is designed to handle 4-bit arithmetic operations, making it a valuable tool for various digital computing tasks.

Operation Control: The core of this unit is a decoder that efficiently controls the selected 4-bit operation, ensuring accurate results for each calculation.

4-Bit Results: The project includes an integrated 7-segment display that conveniently displays the 4-bit results of the operations, making it easy to verify the outcomes.

==> Why NMOS?

NMOS technology offers advantages in terms of power efficiency and ease of integration, making it a suitable choice for this project. The design leverages NMOS components to optimize both functionality and power consumption.

==> Getting Started:

To use and test the NMOS 4-bit Arithmetic Unit, simply load the provided Multisim project file and follow the included documentation. You can then input your 4-bit operands and observe the 4-bit results on the 7-segment display.

We hope this project inspires you and serves as a valuable educational resource for understanding 4-bit digital arithmetic operations and NMOS-based designs.
